**Abstract**

Although body mass index (BMI) is considered a key determinant of high blood pressure, its importance may differ over time and by age group. 
We utilised separate data sources to investigate temporal changes in this association: 23 independent (newly sampled), 
repeated cross-sectional studies (Health Survey for England (HSE)) at ≥25 years (1994–2018; N = 126,742); and three 
British birth cohorts at 43–46 years (born 1946, 1958, and 1970; N = 18,657). In HSE, associations were weaker in more recent years, 
with this trend most pronounced amongst older adults. After adjustment for sex, anti-hypertensive treatment and education, 
the mean difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) per 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI amongst adults ≥55 years was 0.75 mmHg (95%CI: 0.60–0.90) in 1994, 
0.66 mmHg (0.46–0.85) in 2003, and 0.53 mmHg (0.35–0.71) in 2018. 
In the 1958 and 1970 cohorts, BMI and SBP associations were of similar magnitude yet weaker in the 1946 cohort, potentially due to differences in 
blood pressure measurement device. Quantile regression analyses suggested that associations between BMI and SBP were present both below and above the 
hypertension threshold. A weaker association between BMI and blood pressure may partly offset the public health impacts of increasing obesity prevalence. 
However, despite sizable increases in use of antihypertensive medication, BMI remains positively associated with SBP in all ages. Our findings highlight 
the need to tackle non-medical factors such as population diet which influence both BMI and blood pressure, and the utility of using multiple datasets 
to obtain robust inferences on trends in risk factor-outcome associations across time.
